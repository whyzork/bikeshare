### Bikeshare Analysis


### Description
We are investigating bikeshare data using the bikeshare.py to parse csv files and provide a variety of summary statistics about the data based on user input.

### Files used
bikeshare.py currently references three bikeshare data sources:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
The bikeshare.py template from https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/6094a7cc_all-project-files/all-project-files.zip was a valuable start.
